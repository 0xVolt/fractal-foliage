# L-Systems and Formal Grammar to Procedurally Generate Organic Systems

## About

*L-Systems* are models governed by an algorithm developed by Hungarian botanist Aristid Lindenmayer to model cellular growth. The way the algorithm is structured is as a formal grammar with an initial set of symbols (an alphabet), and production rules governed by axiom(s).

L-Systems are all text based, meaning they apply to characters as any grammar would, this repository and project explores L-systems in the world of graphics with the aim to understand how formal grammars can be represented not just as characters but as cool procedurally generated organic-looking graphics (and art!).
